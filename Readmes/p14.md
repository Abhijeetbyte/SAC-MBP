# Automatic Railway Gate Control System

Automatic railway gate control system using ATmega328 microcontroller IC and IR proximity sensors.<br/>
The “Automatic Railway Gate Control” is basically a smart automatic barrier that allows the traffic to cross <br/>
the railway track when there is no train and blocks the traffic when a train passes through tracks.<br/>
It is bidirectional in nature and can detect objects from forward & backward directions, it shows messages on a 16X2 LCD
and produces LED indication for same.<br/>
