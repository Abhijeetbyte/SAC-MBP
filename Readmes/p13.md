# IoT and GSM based coal mine saftey monitoring and alerting system

Mine safety monitoring and alerting system with IoT and GSM, by utilizing Multiple MQ gas detection Temperature sensors.<br/>

ESP32 board used as a microcontroller with SIM900A GSM module for cellular connectivity.<br/>
It can detect the concentration of Methane (CH4) with the help of an MQ-2 sensor and Carbon Monoxide using MQ-7 sensor modules, for ambient temperature measurement LM35 sensor is used.<br/>
If any parameter exceeds the normal threshold limits it will alarm the buzzer and send an SMS alert too. <br/>
The data can live monitored on the [Blynk](https://blynk.io/) IoT app, and also show data on external LCD 16x2 LCD. <br/>
